- can probably just a dictionary as the main structure
    - start with a root in the dictionary
    - if i see a directory, create a new dict with the key as the directory name (but what should be the value?)
    - if i see a file, add it to the dict (how?)
- start with a root in dict
    - if i see a dir, add it as an empty dict
    - if i see a file, use name as key and size as value
    - every time i cd into a directory, push curr dict to a stack, and if i see a .., then i can just pop from stack as curr dict

{
    'root': {
        'a': {
            'e': {
                'i': 584
            }
        }
        'b.text': 14848514
        'c.dat': 8504156
        'd': {}
    }
}
